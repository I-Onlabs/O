# Angry Dogs - Game Design Document

## Game Overview

**Title:** Angry Dogs  
**Genre:** Endless Runner/Shooter Hybrid  
**Platform:** Mobile (iOS/Android) + PC  
**Target Audience:** Casual to Mid-core gamers, ages 13+  
**Development Time:** 6-8 months  

### Core Concept
In 2149 Neo-Tokyo, you're Riley, a clumsy hacker who accidentally rewrote the AI of corporate guard dogs, turning them into "Angry Dogs 2.0"â€”a horde of cybernetic hounds with glowing eyes, hydraulic jaws, and a grudge. They're chasing you through a neon-lit megacity, and you must sprint, shoot obstacles to clear paths, and protect your glitchy pup, Nibble, who's the only dog still on your side.

### Tone & Style
- **Visual:** Cyberpunk meets cartoon chaos - neon-drenched city with cartoonish effects
