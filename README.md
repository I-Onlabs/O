# Angry Dogs - Cyberpunk Endless Runner

A production-ready Unity prototype of the "Angry Dogs" game concept - a chaotic, funny endless runner where you play as Riley, a clumsy hacker being chased by cybernetic hounds through Neo-Tokyo 2149. Now featuring cloud saves, boss encounters, and mobile optimization!

## Game Concept

In 2149 Neo-Tokyo, you're Riley, a hacker who accidentally rewrote the AI of corporate guard dogs, turning them into "Angry Dogs 2.0"â€”a horde of cybernetic hounds with glowing eyes, hydraulic jaws, and a grudge. They're chasing you through a neon-lit megacity, and you must sprint, shoot obstacles to clear paths, and protect your glitchy pup, Nibble, who's the only dog still on your side.

## How to Play

### Unity Version (Recommended)
1. **Open the project in Unity 2022.3 LTS or later**
2. **Controls:**
   - Arrow Keys or WASD: Move Riley
   - Space: Shoot obstacles and Angry Dogs
   - R: Restart (when game over)
   - P: Pause/Resume
   - Settings: Access performance and audio settings

### Web Version (Legacy)
1. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser
2. **Same controls as Unity version**
